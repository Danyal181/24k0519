take a number as an input from the user
initialize a variable named z as 2
initialize a variable named Result as prime
iterate a while loop that will be iterated when z <= number/2
calculate the remainder(rem) by rem=number MOD a/2
if the rem is not equal to zero,increment the value of a by +1
if the rem is equal to zero,change the value of the variable result to not prime
output the result
